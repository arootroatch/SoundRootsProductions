# Sound Roots Productions

This is the active continuous-integration repository for the multi-page website for Sound Roots Productions, the production company for which I am the sole proprietor. Sound Roots Productions provides all live event production needs for 5 locations in 4 cities across Tennessee and Alabama. The site includes:

- Scroll-based transitions between sections that give the illusion that the page is not moving
- A custom scrollbar that looks like a fader on an audio console
- Contact form
- Dynamic feedback form based on city for musicians to review the venue and their experience with their production staff
- Dynamic jobs application page based on city and whether the applicant is uploading a resume

## Motivation

I started my business right before the COVID-19 pandemic hit and halted my entire industry for a few months. In that time, and started learning how to code as a way of diversifying my skill set.

As a result, I wanted to put those skills to the test by custom-coding my company's website. It was important to me to create a unique visual experience that stood out from the SquareSpace and Wordpress themes that we're so used to seeing.
